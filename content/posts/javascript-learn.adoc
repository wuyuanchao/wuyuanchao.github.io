=== TypeScript

TypeScript中的类型，和java或者c#的很不一样：

In TypeScript, this becomes very natural once you realize that every type is just a set. 
How do you describe a value that either belongs in the string set or the number set? 
It simply belongs to the union of those sets: string | number

TypeScript的类型系统是结构型的。类型间的关系是由他们包含的属性决定的。

TypeScript’s type system is structural, not nominal: We can use obj as a Pointlike because it has x and y properties that are both numbers.
 The relationships between types are determined by the properties they contain, not whether they were declared with some particular relationship.
