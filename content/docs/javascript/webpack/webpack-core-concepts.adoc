== Webpack Core Concepts

webpack的核心概念如下：

=== Entry

An entry point indicates which module webpack should use to begin building out its internal dependency graph.

默认情况下，webpack的entry是 src/index.js

=== Output

output是webpack输出目标文件，默认是 dist/main.js

=== Loaders

Loaders用于协助webpack处理JavaScript 和 JSON 文件以外的其他类型的文件，将它们转换成 modules 。

=== Plugins

Plugins即插件，用于处理如：bundle optimization, asset management and injection of environment variables 等任务。

=== Mode

By setting the mode parameter to either development, production or none, you can enable webpack's built-in optimizations that correspond to each environment.

默认为 production 。

=== Browser Compatibility

Webpack supports all browsers that are ES5-compliant (IE8 and below are not supported).
